I just create a flash note app in flutter!!
this might be my new full project, 
I have been creating apps with tutorials, helping and many others. But now for the first time in the time line of learning Flutter,
I just created an entire note-taking app without the help of any others. Of course,
you might ask, I do have to go Google tons of times, but that is what developers do :) xD. 

It's a nice way to practice what you have learned in previous. 
By doing projects on your own, you get closer to knowing what you learn. 
Or are you just copying all the codes from the tutorial all the time? It's the best way to find out.


Anyway, the app is finished. 
I get errors while uploading the Flutter app with keystore. 
There are tons of errors and I'm still solving these on my own with the help of Google.

In the future, I'll develop this app further.
