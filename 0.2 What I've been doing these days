What I've Been Doing These Days, 3:45 AM 5/15/2022

I have been in study mode. I have been studying Flutter and Dart. I need this language and accredition to learn for some backups in order to complete some steps toward my goals.

For students, I may suggest that you don't go straight to Flutter bootcamps or 6+ hour long courses.
Research first what object-orited programming is and some parts of it.
and learn some basics of Dart. For that I recommend- https://www.raywenderlich.com/22685966-dart-basics

If you can confidently say you're over at the basic level at Dart, then start learning Flutter and if you want to find some online courses, I recommend- https://www.udemy.com/share/1013o43@ggtd5daQCIvCoK4wT5ALRE8wrNYewulif5_evNcguEx2vrxwubFS3vCdPFYknnYWmw==/
