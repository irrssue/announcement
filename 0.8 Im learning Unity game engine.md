# I decided to also learn about Unity Game Engine which use C# as a scripting langauge to control the game.

It was always kind of interesting to me to make games, I still remember making my own pinpong game wtih pygame and get all excited and play that for long hours

I think making games is kind of like bringing our imagination to reality but we bascially can't bring out imaginations to reality that's why
we created games and put all together out imagination into games.
