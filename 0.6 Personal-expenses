## so Im new to this

I'm trying to crate a personal expenses app for two days in rwo now.
it would be a good idea to make a app that track your expenses so you will never be problem on where your money went.

but you all might wanna ask, WHY, why that app, that's a lot other apps that can create as a beginner
but here me out, it would be greate if I build an app that would useful. So if any bugs happend since I was using it
always I can notic and track and gain experience.

so yeah all the project file is uptodate on Github.com/irrssue/personal-expenses
and also if you wanna see about notes and planns I made through out the way you can also find note repo in profile
