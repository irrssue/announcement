Hope you're all doing great! I wanted to reach out and share some news - I'm back! After taking a break from software engineering for the past four months, I'm feeling recharged and ready to dive back into coding.

I'm so excited to be working with you all again and I'm looking forward to bringing my new ideas and enthusiasm to the team. I can't wait to catch up with everyone and hear about all the amazing things you've been working on.

If there's anything I can help with or if you have any projects you think I'd be a good fit for, please don't hesitate to let me know. I'm eager to jump in and get started!

Thanks for your continued support, and I'm looking forward to being back and making great things happen together.



Take care,

**Austin Rolert**
