So here is my decision; 
I've been thinking on this for a long time. 
"I will officially take a break for months." 
I'm not sure for how long, but I have been preparing for the International GCSE with very limited time. 
That means I won't be doing any more projects, blogs, book reviews, etc. I'll be concentrating solely on the IGCSE exam. 
My instagram account @irrssue will stay active but less and you can still DM me. Alright, bye-bye, and take care.
